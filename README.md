# KitexTool

KitexTool is an extension tool for the Kitex framework that allows users to quickly initialize various third-party
components through configuration, reducing the workload of project initialization. When integrating third-party
components, KitexTool uses an option method for injection, enabling users to quickly start or stop components with a
single line of option.
